Deep Learning Multi-classification

In this new project, we have developed a multiclassification model for the detection of pneumonia from X-ray images. Our approach involves leveraging transfer learning by utilizing the DenseNet architecture, a powerful pre-trained neural network, to extract meaningful features from X-ray images. To enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities, we have implemented data augmentation techniques, to expand the dataset. However, since our dataset initially consisted of only two labels (indicating the presence or absence of pneumonia), we took a creative approach. We coded a transformation to create three distinct labels, enabling us to train the model for multiclass classification effectively. After this data preprocessing step, we conducted rigorous hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. The results were highly satisfactory, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in pneumonia classification from X-ray images. This project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in medical image classification and highlights the adaptability of deep learning techniques in addressing complex healthcare challenges.
